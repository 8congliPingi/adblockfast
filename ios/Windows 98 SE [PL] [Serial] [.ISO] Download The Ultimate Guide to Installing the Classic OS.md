If you want to experience the nostalgia of using Windows 98 SE on your modern PC, you can download an ISO image of the operating system and install it using a virtual machine or an emulator. In this article, we will show you how to do that step by step.
 
## What You Need
 
To download and install Windows 98 SE on your PC, you will need the following:
 
- A Windows 98 SE ISO image file. You can either use an original CD from Microsoft or a valid ISO file from a trusted source. We recommend using Windows 98 SE, as it has more features and bug fixes than the first edition[^2^]. You can find some ISO files online, but make sure they are safe and legal before downloading them.
- A serial number for Windows 98 SE. You will need this to activate the operating system during the installation process. You can use one of the serials listed on the WinWorld website[^1^], or use your own if you have a legitimate copy of Windows 98 SE.
- A virtual machine or an emulator software. This will allow you to run Windows 98 SE on your PC without affecting your current operating system. There are many options available, such as VMware, VirtualBox, x86Box, or PCem[^2^]. For this guide, we will use VMware Workstation Player, which is free for personal use.
- A blank CD or a USB flash drive. You will need this to burn the ISO image file to a bootable disc or create a bootable USB drive. This will help you start the installation process of Windows 98 SE on your virtual machine or emulator.
