- Create nesting studies from Inventor part and assembly files, or import DXF files.
- Adjust nesting parameters such as sheet size, orientation, spacing, and quantity.
- Generate nested layouts and preview the material utilization and cost estimates.
- Export nested layouts as DXF files for fabrication or as reports for documentation.

Inventor Nesting 2018 is a valuable tool for anyone who needs to cut shapes from flat materials, such as sheet metal, wood, plastic, or composite. It can help you save time, money, and resources by optimizing your cutting process and reducing waste.

In this section, we will explore some of the features and benefits of Inventor Nesting 2018 in more detail.
 
## Integration with Inventor
 
One of the advantages of Inventor Nesting 2018 is that it is fully integrated with Inventor, the 3D CAD software from Autodesk. This means that you can create nesting studies directly from your Inventor part and assembly files, without having to export or import them to another software. You can also access the nesting tools from the Inventor ribbon, making it easy to switch between design and nesting modes.

Another benefit of the integration is that you can use the parametric modeling and associative update features of Inventor to modify your designs and see how they affect your nesting results. For example, if you change the size or shape of a part in Inventor, the nesting layout will automatically update to reflect the changes. This way, you can ensure that your nested layouts are always in sync with your design changes.
 
## Optimization and customization
 
Inventor Nesting 2018 uses a true-shape nesting algorithm that can handle complex shapes and curves, as well as common shapes such as rectangles and circles. It can also nest parts within parts, or use common cuts to reduce material waste. You can adjust various nesting parameters to optimize your layouts according to your needs and preferences. For example, you can specify the sheet size, orientation, spacing, quantity, priority, and rotation of the parts. You can also apply different nesting strategies such as best fit, minimum waste, or maximum parts.
 
In addition to the optimization options, you can also customize your nested layouts by manually moving, rotating, or deleting parts. You can also add labels, dimensions, or annotations to your layouts for identification or documentation purposes. You can also create custom reports that show the material utilization, cost estimates, part list, or other information that you need.
