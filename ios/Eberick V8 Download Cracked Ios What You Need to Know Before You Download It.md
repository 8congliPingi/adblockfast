# How to use Eberick V8 on iOS devices
 
Eberick V8 is a software for structural design that allows you to model, analyze, dimension and detail projects in concrete, steel, masonry and pre-stressed slabs. It is compatible with Windows operating systems and can be integrated with other BIM disciplines.
 
But what if you want to use Eberick V8 on your iOS device, such as an iPhone or an iPad? Is it possible to cross-compile Eberick V8 for iOS targets?

The answer is yes, but it requires some additional steps and tools. In this article, we will show you how to build a monolithic version of Eberick V8 for iOS using the V8 engine, which is a JavaScript engine developed by Google and used in Chrome and other web browsers.

## Requirements
 
To build Eberick V8 for iOS, you will need:
 
- A macOS (OS X) host machine with Xcode installed.
- A 64-bit target iOS device (legacy 32-bit iOS devices are unsupported).
- V8 v7.5 or newer.
- The flags '--expose\_gc --jitless' to enable jitless mode, which is a hard requirement for iOS (as of Dec. 2020).

## Initial setup
 
First, you need to follow the instructions to [download](https://www.altoqi.com.br/downloads) and [install](https://www.altoqi.com.br/eberick) Eberick V8 on your macOS machine.
 
Next, you need to fetch additional tools needed for iOS cross-compilation by adding target\_os in your .gclient configuration file, located in the parent directory of the v8 source directory:

    # [... other contents of .gclient such as the 'solutions' variable ...]
    target_os = ['ios']

After updating .gclient, run gclient sync to download the additional tools.
 
## Manual build
 
This section shows how to build a monolithic version of Eberick V8 for use on either a physical iOS device or the Xcode iOS simulator. The output of this build is a libv8\_monolith.a file that contains all V8 libraries as well as the V8 snapshot.
 
Set up GN build files by running gn args out/release-ios and inserting the following keys:

    enable_ios_bitcode = true
    ios_deployment_target = 10
    is_component_build = false
    is_debug = false
    target_cpu = "arm64" # "x64" for a simulator build.
    target_os = "ios"
    use_custom_libcxx = false # Use Xcode's libcxx.
    use_xcode_clang = true
    v8_enable_i18n_support = false # Produces a smaller binary.
    v8_monolithic = true # Enable the v8_monolith target.
    v8_use_external_startup_data = false # The snaphot is included in the binary.
    v8_enable_pointer_compression = false # Unsupported on iOS.

Now build:

    ninja -C out/release-ios v8_monolith

Finally, add the generated libv8\_monolith.a file to your Xcode project as a static library. For further documentation on embedding V8 in your application, see [Getting started with embedding V8](https://v8.dev/docs/embed).
 
## Conclusion
 
In this article, we showed you how to use Eberick V8 on your iOS device by cross-compiling it with the V8 engine. This way, you can enjoy the features and benefits of Eberick V8 on your mobile device and work on your structural design projects anywhere.
